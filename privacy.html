            the Site.

        </p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy covers two types of information gathered at the Site, personal and aggregated. The term

        third party booking engine ("Booking Engine") provided by our property management system vendor While it appears
        to be part of our site, the booking engine is in fact provided by a third party and is governed by its privacy
        practices. We understand that security remains the primary concern of online consumers and have chosen the
        Booking Engine Vendor carefully
        </p>
        <p>

        in an anonymous way. Disclosure of aggregated data does not reveal personal information about individual Site
        users in any way that identifies who they are or how to contact them.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h2>Exception To The Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>The Hotel has two exceptions to these limits on use of personal information:

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Hotel may monitor and, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is required, disclose
                information to protect the security, property, assets and/or rights of Hotel from unauthorized use, or
                misuse, of the Site or anything found at the Site.</li>
            <li>PThe Hotel may disclose information when required by law; however, only to the extent necessary and in a
                manner that seeks to maintain the privacy of the individual.
            </li>


        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h2>Use Of Cookies</h2>
        <p>To enable features at the Site, Hotel may assign one or more "cookies" to your Internet browser. Cookies,
            among other things, speed navigation through our Site, keep track of information so that you do not have to
            re-enter it each time you visit our Site, and may provide you with customized content. A cookie is an
            Internet mechanism composed of a small text file containing a unique identification number that permits a
            web server to send small pieces of information or text by means of your browser and place them on your
            computer's hard drive for storage. This text lets the web server know if you have previously visited the web
            page. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user.


        </p>
        <p>We use cookies to collect and maintain aggregated data (such as the number of visitors) to help us see which
            areas are most popular with our users and improve and update the content on our site. While in the process
            of browsing our site, you also provide us with information that doesn't reveal your personal identity --
            what type of destination you're exploring, for example. We use this aggregated data only as explained in
            this Privacy Policy. We do not connect aggregated data to any name, address, or other identifying
            information.

        </p>
        <p>You may occasionally receive cookies from unaffiliated companies or organizations, to the extent they place
            advertising on our Site or are linked to the Site. These third-party cookies may collect information about
            you when you "click" on their advertising or content or link. This practice is standard in the Internet
            industry. Because of the way in which the Internet operates, we cannot control collection of this
            information by these third parties, and these cookies are not subject to this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <h2>Children's Privacy & Parental Consent</h2>
        <p>Please be aware that Hotel has not designed this Site for, and does not intend for it to be used by, anyone
            under age 18. Accordingly, this Site should not be used by anyone under age 18. Our privacy policy prohibits
            us from accepting users who are under the age of 18. The Hotel specifically requests that persons under the
            age of 18 not use this Site or submit or post information to the Site. Should the Hotel inadvertently
            acquire personal information or other data from users under the age of 18, the Hotel will not knowingly
            provide this data to any third party for any purpose whatsoever, and any subsequent disclosure would be due
            to the fact the user under age 18 used the Site and submitted personal information without solicitation by
            or permission from the Hotel.


        </p>
        <h2>Links Provided To Other Sites</h2>
        <p>The Hotel may provide links to a number of other web sites that we believe might offer you useful information
            and services. However, those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as the Hotel. Therefore, we are
            not responsible for the privacy policies or the actions of any third parties, including without limitation,
            any web site owners whose sites may be reached through this Site, nor can we control the activities of those
            web sites. We urge you to contact the relevant parties controlling these sites or accessing their on-line
            policies for the relevant information about their data collection practices before submitting any personal
            information or other sensitive data


        </p>
        <p>
        <h2>Your Consent To This Privacy Policy</h2>
        Use of the Site signifies your consent, as well as the consent of the company for whom you use the Site and
        whose information you submit (if any), to this on-line Privacy Policy, including the collection and use of
        information by the Hotel, as described in this statement, and also signifies agreement to the terms of use for
        the Site. Continued access and use of the Site without acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy relieves
        the Hotel from responsibility to the user.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h2>Policy Modification & Contacting Hotel</h2>
        The Hotel reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time; notice of changes will be published on
        this page. Changes will always be prospective, not retroactive. If you have questions about our policies, please
        contact:
        </p>
